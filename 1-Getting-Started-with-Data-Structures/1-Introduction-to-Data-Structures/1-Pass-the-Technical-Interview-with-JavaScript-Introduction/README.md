#Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript Introduction


In this path, you’ll learn the fundamentals of many important computer science concepts, from foundational data structures like linked lists and graphs to important algorithms such as quicksort and Dijkstra’s algorithm. At each step, you’ll first learn the concepts behind the topic before applying them specifically in JavaScript.

Throughout, you’ll use modern ES6 JavaScript and will build most of your code using class syntax. Classes are a (relatively) recent addition to JavaScript, and they’ll more closely resemble how these data structures would be built in a classic computer science curriculum. They’ll also allow us to use object-oriented programming techniques to implement our data structures. You’ll start out building a basic data-storing Node class, and as you progress, you’ll build many more complex data structures on top of it.

In addition to building the data structures themselves, you’ll learn about techniques for using them, from different iteration strategies to analyzing the algorithmic complexity of operations. After that, you’ll learn and implement algorithms for efficient searching, sorting, and pathfinding.

Finally, we’ll discuss some techniques for effectively solving algorithmic technical interview questions, and you’ll practice implementing efficient solutions to some classic technical interview problems
